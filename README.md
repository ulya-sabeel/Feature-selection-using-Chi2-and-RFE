# Feature Selection:

Feature selection is the process of selecting the best group of attributes from a dataset without mutating them.

**Chi2 statistical test:** This test comes under filter method of feature selection. Scores are created based on the correlation between a continuous or categorical feature and a continuous or categorical target variable. It measures whether an observed feature is related to the target variable. If the Chi-Square value is high, the target is dependent on that feature and this feature has high importance and vice versa.

**Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):** This technique comes under wrapper method of feature selection which identifies feature subsets based on their efficacy for improving the performance of an AI model. In this case, best features are selected at each iteration and their ranking is done based on the order of elimination.
